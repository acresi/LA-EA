# Ontology Overview

This ontology defines the living Agents that guide the Life Architect repository.

## Principles

- Every Agent embodies a core role within the architecture.
- Invocation syntax allows dynamic interaction with Agents in project systems.
- Agents adapt over time but must maintain integrity to their initial purpose.
