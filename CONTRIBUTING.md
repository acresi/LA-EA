# Contributing to Life Architect: Engine of Alignment

Thank you for wanting to be part of this living structure.

## Principles
- All work should honor the Eight Categories of Alignment.
- Contributions must aim to increase clarity, coherence, or meaningful connection.
- Refine iteratively. Build with respect for progression, not perfection.
- Share your insights â€” teaching and documenting are vital acts of contribution.
- Utilize Agents

## How to Start
- Review [RULESET.json](./RULESET.json) and the Eight Categories.
- When opening a pull request, describe which category your work supports.

Alignment first. Action second. Together, we create meaning.
